## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental tools in computer science used to arrange data elements in a specific order. They play a crucial role in various applications and serve as building blocks for other algorithms. Understanding the different sorting techniques helps programmers optimize their code and solve problems efficiently.

The implementations in this repository serve as educational resources for students at Holberton School, providing hands-on experience with different sorting algorithms and promoting a deeper understanding of their underlying principles.

## Implemented Algorithms

The repository includes the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort

Each algorithm is implemented in multiple programming languages, allowing students to compare and contrast the implementation details across different languages.

## Directory Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `algorithm_name/`: Each sorting algorithm has its own directory named after the algorithm.
  - `algorithm_name.c`: The implementation of the sorting algorithm in C programming language.
  - `algorithm_name.py`: The implementation of the sorting algorithm in Python programming language.
  - `algorithm_name.js`: The implementation of the sorting algorithm in JavaScript programming language.
  - `README.md`: A README file specific to the sorting algorithm, providing additional information and details about the algorithm.
